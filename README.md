A Haskell implementation of the Northeastern CS4500 (Software Development) Fall 2022 project  
[https://felleisen.org/matthias/4500-f22/index.html](Course Website)

## Why?
I was a TA for this course, and I originally wanted to follow along with the milestones on my own,
but I quickly became too busy for it. I also wanted to learn Haskell by working through a familiar
project. I'm doing it now after the semester has ended so it can be viewed publicly.

## Contents
I'm starting with just milestone 2 (the board) for now. This is mainly about practicing Haskell
for me, so I might not follow the milestones exactly. It's really about what catches my interest.
